# Hello my Dear Reader! 

I am Yin Minn Pa Pa, originally from Myanmar and currently working at Japan as security researcher. 
I finished Ph.D in computer engineering in 2016 from Yokohama National University, Japan. 

My research interests include: 

* Network security 
* Malware Analysis 
* IoT security 
* Web security 

This site is made to  document what I learn and share it to burmese learners. 

Most contents will be written in burmese because learning with mother toung is the easiest way to grasp the point. 

I would be happy if someone learn something from here. 

Thanks for reading! 
 
Yin Minn Pa Pa
